Remember the doctor said we take your medicine when that happens.\n[07:51] Child: I don't like the taste.\n[07:53] Caregiver: I know it’s icky, but it helps the pain go away. Let’s take one spoon together and then we can sip some juice.\n[07:59] Child: Okay…\n[08:02] Caregiver: Good job! Now come cuddle on the couch; we’ll read your favorite book while the medicine works.",
